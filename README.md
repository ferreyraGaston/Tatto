 # Testing
 - I comfirmed that this project is responsiv, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes  using the devtool device.
 - I have comfirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field.
 - I have comfirmed that all links works.

 # Bugs
 - There was issues when going down to smaller screensizes due to lack of flexibility in certain images which made small screensizes floated outside of the screen so the burger menu was not reachable. Making the problematic images responsive fixed this issue. 
 - the portfolio didnt line up properly and started to fill up from the top and down not from side to side. Removing a few images and changing the size fixed this issue.

# Validator testing
- html
    - No error were returned when passing through the offical w3C validator

    - No error were returned when passing through the offical jigsaw validator

- accessibility
    - The webpaged had good accessibility however due to many large pictures made the website work slowly and that made the performance go down.
